This is a full-stack web application built with React, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS.

It was a semester priject as an individual project task for [Hack Your Future](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH) Denmark's curriculum.


The main functionalities of this website are:

-   Creating a data base by SQL and using Docker
-   Displaying the meals in the database
-   Making a reservation

## Technologies Used

-   Express.js
-   KnexJS
-   PostgreSQL
-   React
-   CSS Modules

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I faced several challenges that helped me learn new skills and technologies. Some of the challenges I faced include building building a database and Fack-end by SQL and Node.js and later displaying it through Front-end commponents in React.

Through these challenges, I was able to gain a better understanding of React, CSS Modules, and Front-end and Back-end Development in general. I also learned how to work with Node.js, Express.js, KnexJS, and PostgreSQL to build a full-stack web application. Deploying the app was also a big challange that made me to learn more about PostgreSQL.

In addition to these technical skills, I also learned how to manage my time effectively and prioritize tasks to meet deadlines.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me and helped me grow as a developer.
